Large cliffs and plateaus cover this area full of dense greenery. The sounds of creatures populating these forests fill the air, between the occasional boom of thunder. Bright skies sparkle and fill with bolts of electricity, displaying the wonder of Ourobos' high charge.

## Description

These forests are filled with high elevations and tall trees. In addition to these, large lakes and rivers weave through this area, making it extremely difficult to traverse. 

The creatures themselves are comprised of various small reptiles and insects, as well as a plethora of birds and other small prey. Because of this, larger nocturnal beasts prowl the area into the nights.

## Notable Inhabitants
