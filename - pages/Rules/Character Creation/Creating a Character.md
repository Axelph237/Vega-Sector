| Foraging        | You've always enjoyed scavenging and utilizing the bounty of Mother Nature.                                                                                             |
| Gambling        | Cards, dice, betting, bluffing, you know the drill. In fact, you know it so well that people stopped playing against you.                                               |

| Jumping         | Your legs are like cannons, firing off and launching you distances much farther than others.                                                                            |
| Literature      | Be it reading, writing, or recognizing old texts, the study of literature has always been your forte.                                                                   |

| Shooting        | Aiming down the sights of a rifle is more than natural to you, it's home. You excel in utilizing ranged weaponry.                                                       |
| Slight of Hand  | The dexterity of your hands beats the human eye. Card tricks and petty theft are never out of reach for you.                                                            |
