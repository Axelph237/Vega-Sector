# Stitching: The end of Large Scale war
- Humanity works to create a super intelligent AI
- In the making of said AI there was a limiting factor
- Researchers could not understand why the AI was unable to advance to a point of complete understanding of all physics
- Mathematicians and Physicists worked to solve what this AI was unable to
- They found a small discrepancy in old scientific laws
- This had to do with space time and its relation to three dimensional space
- From this, a new branch of theoretical physics was created colloquially called "Stitching"
- "Stitching" is the study of ripping space time into three dimensional space, and then manipulating it as such. 
- After the discovery of stitching, all major nations quickly advanced to create technology that would allow them to harness the power of space time.
- From this, a dooms day device was made, and during an intergalactic war it was used to turn an entire galaxy into a supermassive black hole with the snap of your fingers.

# Ourobos
- Ourobos 
	- Gravity is higher at night than in day
		- This implies that fauna utilizes low gravity during the day, also there might be rocks and structures that float around making some places very dangerous in terms of collision, places with high density of flora are ironically safer because rocks are "tied down"
	- Has high plate tectonics
	- Extreme weather conditions
	- Animals are more active during the day
	- Nocturnal predators are extremely strong and powerful
	- Diurnal animals have lots of passive self defense mechanics to avoid said predators
	- Plants that can store electric charge from lightning strikes (voltflare bush)
		- These plants act like lightning rods

- Biomes
	- Desert [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/352f445c5470b9b4c7faf0e6)
		- Largely covered in a sand made from volcanic rock
			- Combination darker rocks and quartz
		- The volcanic rock was eroded by an ocean that was once there
		- after it had dried up, the residual sand is a mix of black and white
		- Due to tectonic shifts, the larger quartz pebbles are sifted from the darker sands creating streams of white and black pebbles across the desert
		- Photosynthesizing animals
			- Big lizard with a coat of scales that reflect and absorb light for energy
				- This makes them a great mode of transportation due to their passive mode of energizing
			- Insects with transparent wings that refract sunlight, creating a dazzling display as they skim over the sand. Their bodies are equipped with crystalline structures that allow them to convert sunlight into energy.
				- Maybe also potentially rideable ðŸ‘€
		- Birds with reflective feathers that use the shimmering of the light to communicate
			- Feast on a plant that extracts minerals from the quartz. They use these minerals to produce their reflective sheen
	- Silent Forest (variant)
		- Peaceful ambiance
		- A creature that resembles an inviting species (from wherever you are native)
			- No one knows what it truly looks like
			- But no one survives a close proximity encounter with it
			- Due to this, the forest is largely silent aside from these creatures
			- Although not carnivorous, they are highly territorial, leading to the aggressive nature
			- These creatures are nomadic
		- The forests are... oddly silent
	- Forest  [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/ec8f5ef3b664f1eb909fbb73)
		- 
	- Lush Forest [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/f6e3c5a0d9956cc4a14cacbc)
		- Extreme verticality and cliffsides
		- Large, green trees
		- Wide rivers and lakes
		- Small, reptilian creatures scutter across the ground
		- Many small bird species live here
		- Nocturnal predators lie camouflaged in the trees during the day
			- These creatures, of a slick form, come out at night to hunt prey
			- They will generally eat whatever seems possible to them
		- Some insects have eyes across their back abdomen
			- This allows them to crawl along trees and look out into the grottos
	- Hills [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/fde5ecfcbaade48586916db3)
		- Covered in vast fields of a light purple grass
		- The grass sparkles at the blinking of stars in the night
		- Adorned with a variety of saturated orange and white flowers
		- Hilly terrain with a variety of streams running along it
		- Mostly maintains prey vegetarians
		- Some flying creatures make migrations across the fields during the day
		- A species of massive arachne creatures roam the fields, covered in the flora of the plains
			- These creatures make a migration their whole lives from one end of the fields to the other, birthing their young near the ocean
			- The ability of plants to grow on their porous exoskeletons allows the plants to spread their seeds further
			- The plants also attract prey, allowing the arachne to idly hunt approaching food
	- Swamp [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/eac696c8ae7d76582765451f)
		- inconsistent depth, muddy waters fill this biome
		- Small shrubbery, but few trees
		- Below the surface are large underwater creatures
			- Person size carnivorous worms in the deeper areas
			- Amphibious monkey-like creatures in the shallower areas
		- At night, flocks of firefly-like insects fill the air
			- The lights signal a rare species of flower to bloom
			- The fireflies nest within the blooms of the flower, laying their eggs
			- When the parent dies, its body is used as a host to grow a new flower where it fell
		- Hippo-like boars roam the surface areas of the swamp
			- These boars are the prey of the monkey-like creatures
			- These are vegetarians, despite their huge teeth
			- The monkeys use the shallow waters to evade herds of the boars
		- Tectonic shifts agitate the waters, sometimes angering the larger worms and drawing them to the surface of the water
	- Underground
		- Larger interconnected tunnels created by a civilization past
		- Tunnels were made by the taming of some large subterranean creature
		- These creatures are now extinct and the civilization gone
		- But ruins remain
		- Current creatures: 
			- Enormous moth-like insects with long proboscises that can tap into underground reservoirs to extract water. Their iridescent wings filter and refract the ambient light, providing an otherworldly spectacle. `GPT`
			- Giant ants that cultivate fungi around geothermal vents, using the heat to stimulate the growth of luminescent mushrooms. They have a complex caste system and navigate through the tunnels with exceptional teamwork. `GPT`
				- Very territorial
				- Will battle other colonies
			- Squid polyp like creature that feeds off of toxic gasses in the air. They are indications of toxic environments.
			- Glass skinned gecko that eats the fruit of a cave roof hanging plant
				- the plant is propagated underground and grows upwards
				- It breaks through the surface
				- Its fruit is bioluminescent (think glowberries)
				- when well lit due to the consumption of fruit, will seek out other well lit geckos to mate
			- Large, bioluminescent centipedes
				- Create massive, intricate mosaic webs
				- They use crystals harvested by their large mandibles and hang them on the web
				- They then sit on the web and shine with a bioluminescence, their glow reflected by the crystals
				- This simulates the same glow of the hanging fruit of the berries
				- Their main source of food are the geckos
			- Worm species that hides near geothermal vents
				- In contest with the ants
				- secretes a tar like substance
				- The tar coalesces onto debris dug by the worms
				- This creates a multitude of spikes attached to the worms
				- Like a porcupine, they can launch these spikes

# Combat

**Narrative Description:**
Bullets whiz past your cover as you fear to stand up. Your cover hardly enough to protect you from the onslaught of enemy fire. A glass capsule slams into the ground next to you, shattering. Steaming from the canister is a dark purple gas, quickly permeating your now useless defense.

Standing up you sprint, taking off down past the oncoming fire. A bullet pierces your shoulder. Blood splattering against your cheek as you press on, dropping to the ground and sliding behind an undisturbed concrete wall. Rubble surrounding you.

You quickly peak the corner of the cover, shells pouring from the side of your rifle like a fountain. The hollow brass clinking against the ground, synonymous with the sound of gunfire. 

**The Simple Rules:**
```
- Players get three stamina points a turn. They may spend these on actions.
- Starting with the player of the highest grace and going CW, each player takes 1 action before passing to the next player. Player turns end when they are out of stamina points.
- Movement is made on a grid of 5x5 ft squares. Moving into a square costs 5 feet of movement.
- Players may request to do an action not specifically listed on their card. The resolution of said action is up to the Game Master (how much stamina it would cost, if the player should roll, etc.)
- If a player is ever downed, they are comatose and will need to be resusitated later
```

**Feel:**
- I want turns to go quickly as far as decision making goes
- I want players to feel cool
- I want players to have options
- I *really* want consumables to be worth using
	- Maybe get rid of consumables for reusable items
- I want players to feel like it is a shooter game
- I want positioning to matter
- Guns should feel different from one another
- I don't want combat to feel rigged or impossible
	- Dice rolls should rarely be all-or-nothing
- **Dice rolls and systems should mimic the feel of using that weapon**
	- i.e. rolling a 1d4 for a sniper rifle would be too light in correspondence

**Mechanics:**
- Will need to be action based in some manner
	- I want actions to be expendable, not so heavy like in DND
		- DND actions are very valuable because they are the bulk of your turn, so they are few and far between
	- A player gets X actions per turn
	- Every turn they choose cards from their hand up to their action count
	- If a player does not use all their actions one turn, they may use 1 more next turn (Take a Breath)
- After cards are chosen, initiative is determined based on the highest initiative card played by someone
- Players always have a base movement they get on their turn
	- This movement *must* be taken during one of their committed actions
		- This may do things like decrease accuracy
	- They can commit a sprint action to gain double movement and an isolated movement action
- Try to keep math simple. Maybe only addition
	- If subtraction, make it minimal (digits 1-9)
	- If multiplication, make it minimal (only halfing)
	- Possibly no multiplication

**Guns:**
```
Global Stats:
- Handling
- Stability
```
- Will have different mechanics based on magazine type
- Will also have a number of rounds they can shoot in a turn
- Your `handling` affects the dice you roll for `stability` checks
- The `stability` of a weapon dictates the TN you roll under to hit. There are two numbers dividing "point blank" | "optimal range" | "far range" sections for attacking. Attacks made at a standard TN, far and point blank decreases the TN.

Magazine based:
```
Stats:
- Magazine Size
- Calibre
- Fire Rate
```
- You have a dice pool equal to your `magazine size`
- You have a `calibre` equaling the dice size rolled
- You also have a `fire rate` equaling the number of dice you can use in an action
- When a player chooses to fire, they determine a number of shots less than or equal to their `fire rate`
	- After firing, these dice are removed from their magazine
	- If magazine is empty, a reload must be made before shooting again

Overheating weapons:
```
Stats:
- Power
- Integrity
```
- The dice you roll is equal to your `power`
- Your `integrity` is the overheating threshold
- A player rolls `power` dice until they choose to stop or exceed their `integrity`
	- They deal damage equal to the dice rolled
	- If they exceed, they take damage and then must wait for their gun to cool down

**Fold Weapons**
Highly illegal, uses stitching. So uhm. Broken?

## Tags

**Throwables**
Hit or miss rolls. Have two stats: `Power`, `Stability`. Handling dice default to `2d12` for throwables.

For every failed point on the `Stability` check, the item is throw 5 feet farther from its intended destination (where determined by GM).

When a throwable is thrown, it must then be retrieved by visiting the space it was thrown to.

**Explosives**
Explosive weapons resolve damage differently from other weapons. The number of dice an explosive weapon's `Power` has is proportionate to its area of affect. i.e. if its `Power` is `3d4`, it has a total area of affect of a 10 ((3 dice * 5 feet) - 5 feet for the directly hit square) foot radius.

Damage is resolved as follows: for every 5 feet away a creature is, it takes one less dice of damage.

> [!example]
> An attack is made with an explosive weapon of **Power** 4d6 (area of affect: 15 feet).
> The attack roll resolves to: 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 14
> - Creatures directly hit will take all 14 damage.
> - Creatures 5 feet away will take 13 (3 + 4 + 6) damage.
> - Creatures 10 feet away will take 10 (4 + 6) damage.
> - Creatures 15 feet away will take 6 damage.

Explosive damage is unavoidable by movement or team affiliation, but strong barricades completely nullify any potential damage taken.

# Gambling  Game

- Needs to be able to be gambled on, but doesn't have to  just be a poker style game
- Should be lightweight and easy to play/learn

### The game would proceed as follows:
- All face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks, Aces) are removed from the deck
- Every player is dealt 4 cards
- They then bet on their likelihood of winning the hand (explained more later)
- All players must call to the highest bet to stay in the game (otherwise they fold)
- 2d6 is rolled, setting the Hand Number
- Players then take turns starting with the player to the left of the dealer

**Player Turns:**
- May choose to challenge previous player (explained more later)
- Draw one card
- Place one card from their hand face down in front of themselves

**Challenging:**
When a player is challenged, they must reveal their face down cards. Total the face values of the cards in their stack. Cards whose face value matches the Hand Number are counted as 0. If their stack total surpasses the Hand Number, they are out of the game. Otherwise, the player who challenged them is out of the game.

**Winning the hand:**
A player wins the hand if they are the last player in the game, then taking the pot.
