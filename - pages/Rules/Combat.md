## Start of Combat
At the start of combat, all players are required to

## Round Phases

### Commit Actions
During this phase of a round, all players choose a number of actions from their deck. The total [[Combat#Stamina Points|stamina point]] cost may not exceed that player's maximum action points. Once all players have chosen their actions, they then reveal their cards. Each player then takes their card  with the highest initiative, and makes that value their round initiative.

### Player Turns
Player turns proceed in terms of initiative from highest to lowest value. If multiple players share the same initiative, they can choose the order in which they take their turns.

During a player's turn, they may take the actions of any number of their committed action cards. These actions can be taken in any order, and can be taken at any point later in initiative as well. In addition to these actions, a player also is able to take a free movement action equal to half of their maximum movement speed. 

Once all players have either run out of stamina or have all unanimously [[Combat#Passing|passed]], a new round is started

#### Stamina Points
During a player's turn, stamina points are spent by playing actions. The stamina cost of an action skill is shown on the action itself. Actions played must always be either committed actions or flex actions.

#### Passing
If a player would like to save an action for later in initiative, they must "Pass" after completing as many of their actions as they wished to.

#### Flex Actions
In addition to a player's committed actions, a player may also take flex actions. A flex action still has a stamina cost, but is considered active for all players and does not need to be committed to be used.
