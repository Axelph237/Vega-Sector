When taking an attack action, an attack may be made with any currently readied weapon the player has. The first step of an attack is determining if the attack hits, then seeing how much damage is dealt.

## Determining Hits
When seeing if an attack hits, the creature must roll against their weapon's `stability`. The `stability` of a weapon is the target number to roll under in order to successfully hit a target. Melee weapons only have one `stability` number, where ranged weapons have two (See [[Attacking#Ranged Weapons#Determining Hits|Ranged Weapons]] for more info). The standard dice for a `stability` check is `2d12`. However, this is different for [[Attacking#Firearms#Determining Hits|firearms]]. If a hit is successful, damage is dealt and/or on-hit affects are triggered.



## Ranged Weapons

### Range


### Determining Hits
A ranged weapon has two different `stability` numbers shown in a pair as (lower # / higher #). The lower of the two numbers is used when the target is outside of a ranged weapons optimal range
