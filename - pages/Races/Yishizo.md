# History
The Yishizo are the progeny of humans, but have changed to adapt to the environment of Ourobos. 

Amidst the inaugural Olympia mission, the United Space Committee experienced a critical loss of control, resulting in the disconnection of all 12 crew members. This unforeseen disruption, likely induced by an unanticipated surge in charged particles within the system, rendered all communication futile. Confronted with limited alternatives, the expedition, under the guidance of Chinese astronaut Qian Xifeng, descended upon Vega-c, a celestial body known as Ourobos and identified within the habitable zone.

Upon touchdown, the explorers discovered a verdant but shattered and craggy landscape adorned with unfamiliar flora and fauna. Armed with this insight, the team ingeniously utilized their meager resources to establish a sustained encampment. However, the realization dawned swiftly that dwindling rations and unsuccessful attempts at agriculture were inadequate for prolonged survival. Faced with starvation, biologist Mainard Faure proposed a groundbreaking solutionâ€”harnessing the anatomy of indigenous fauna to aid in the digestion of exotic flora. The extraction of these organs proved surprisingly manageable, exhibiting characteristics reminiscent of mammalian anatomy. Driven by desperation, a willing volunteer for the operation emerged. A localized digestive tract, procured from the indigenous species, was transplanted into the recipient. Despite the initial resistance, the recipient gradually acquiesced to the foreign components. Genetic splicing pills were administered to expedite the adaptation process.

Unbeknownst at the time was the enduring impact these essential alterations would imprint upon subsequent generations. This unforeseen legacy ultimately birthed a subspecies of humanity, distinct and divergent. Beyond their anthropomorphic stature and intellectual capacities, the Yishizo are scarcely recognizable as human.
