Skills make up a bulk of a character's core progression. Each skill is assigned a parent [[Creating a Character#Attributes|attribute]], relating it to a broader category of skills. 

## Types of Skills
There are two primary kinds of skills, proficiencies and actions. Each of these are considered skills for the sake of anything that refers to skills. However, each are distinct from each other.

### Proficiencies
These are things that a character is particularly good at. There are a variety of different kinds of proficiencies, but most are common proficiencies.

**Common Proficiency**
This kind of proficiency relates to any general ability a character is learning. Common proficiencies grant a roll modifier to any roll made pertaining to the proficiency. For example, a proficiency in lock picking would grant you a roll modifier when picking a analog lock, but would not grant you a modifier when hacking a digital lock.

**Utility Proficiency**
This version of proficiency functions more uniquely than a common proficiency. Utility proficiency is typically on a case-by-case basis. These grant some modifier to the tool they are related to. This typically means a roll modifier (making them similar to common proficiencies), but others can affect different stats when active.

### Actions
These do not passively affect a character like proficiencies. Instead, an action skill allows a player to take new or improved actions during combat and occasionally narrative phases. They have an action point cost in addition to their effect and [[Creating a Character#Attributes|attribute]] type.

Players can gain proficiencies during moments of rest. During this time, they can determine something that their character intends to learn and become proficient in. When a skill is gained, it is added to a character's skill deck. Skills in this deck are not active, and grant no effect.
