# Grid
Movement is performed along a square grid. Movement from one square to any cardinally or diagonally adjacent square is considered to be 10 feet of movement. 
# Difficult Terrain
Some tiles may be considered *difficult terrain*. A tile that is difficult terrain takes a bonus 10 feet of movement to enter. Additionally, a GM may choose to make other forms of movement considered difficult terrain. Some of these include things like scaling stairs and opening doors. 

Here are some examples of difficult terrain:
- Waist-high water
- A closed door
- Vaulting a short wall
- Dense shrubbery
# Types of Movement
There are various types of movement that each handle a player's base movement stat differently.
## Walking
This is the default form of movement. Walking counts a player's base movement normally.
## Sprinting
When sprinting, the player may move double their base movement.
## Swimming
During swimming, all tiles traversed are difficult terrain.
