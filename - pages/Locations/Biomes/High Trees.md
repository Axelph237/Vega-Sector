Large cliffs and plateaus cover this area full of dense greenery. The sounds of creatures populating these forests fill the air, between the occasional boom of thunder. Bright skies sparkle and fill with bolts of electricity, displaying the wonder of Ourobos' high charge.

## Description

These forests are filled with high elevations and tall trees. In addition to these, large lakes and rivers weave through this area, making it extremely difficult to traverse. 

The creatures themselves are comprised of various small reptiles and insects, as well as a plethora of birds and other small prey. Because of this, larger nocturnal beasts prowl the area into the nights.

## Notable Inhabitants
### Fauna
**Moon Leopards**
These large quadrupeds wander the forests at night, sleeping camouflaged in the trees during the day. Their slick, black exterior makes them sink into the shadows of the evening darkness. With no singular prey species, Moon Leopards tend to hunt whatever seems possible to them.

**Tree's Eye**
Many small insects crawl along the flora within the High Trees. Most notably are the Tree's Eye, an insect whose entire back is comprised of a multitude of eyeballs. They are most commonly seen resting on the trunks of trees, watching the grottos from their elevated positions.
