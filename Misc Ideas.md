> Jot anything and everything that comes to mind here

- Ourobos 
	- Gravity is higher at night than in day
	- Has high plate tectonics
	- Extreme weather conditions
	- Animals are more active during the day
	- Nocturnal predators are extremely strong and powerful
	- Diurnal animals have lots of passive self defense mechanics to avoid said predators
	- Plants that can store electric charge from lightning strikes (voltflare bush)
		- These plants act like lightning rods

- Biomes
	- Desert [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/352f445c5470b9b4c7faf0e6)
		- Largely covered in a sand made from volcanic rock
			- Combination darker rocks and quartz
		- The volcanic rock was eroded by an ocean that was once there
		- after it had dried up, the residual sand is a mix of black and white
		- Due to tectonic shifts, the larger quartz pebbles are sifted from the darker sands creating streams of white and black pebbles across the desert
		- Photosynthesizing animals
			- Big lizard with a coat of scales that reflect and absorb light for energy
				- This makes them a great mode of transportation due to their passive mode of energizing
			- Insects with transparent wings that refract sunlight, creating a dazzling display as they skim over the sand. Their bodies are equipped with crystalline structures that allow them to convert sunlight into energy.
				- Maybe also potentially rideable ðŸ‘€
		- Birds with reflective feathers that use the shimmering of the light to communicate
			- Feast on a plant that extracts minerals from the quartz. They use these minerals to produce their reflective sheen
	- Silent Forest (variant)
		- Peaceful ambiance
		- A creature that resembles an inviting species (from wherever you are native)
			- No one knows what it truly looks like
			- But no one survives a close proximity encounter with it
			- Due to this, the forest is largely silent aside from these creatures
			- Although not carnivorous, they are highly territorial, leading to the aggressive nature
			- These creatures are nomadic
		- The forests are... oddly silent

		- 
	- Lush Forest [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/f6e3c5a0d9956cc4a14cacbc)
		- Extreme verticality and cliffsides
		- Large, green trees
		- Wide rivers and lakes
		- Small, reptilian creatures scutter across the ground
		- Many small bird species live here
		- Nocturnal predators lie camouflaged in the trees during the day
			- These creatures, of a slick form, come out at night to hunt prey
			- They will generally eat whatever seems possible to them
		- Some insects have eyes across their back abdomen
			- This allows them to crawl along trees and look out into the grottos
	- Hills [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/fde5ecfcbaade48586916db3)
		- Covered in vast fields of a light purple grass
		- The grass sparkles at the blinking of stars in the night
		- Adorned with a variety of saturated orange and white flowers
		- Hilly terrain with a variety of streams running along it
		- Mostly maintains prey vegetarians
		- Some flying creatures make migrations across the fields during the day
		- A species of massive arachne creatures roam the fields, covered in the flora of the plains
			- These creatures make a migration their whole lives from one end of the fields to the other, birthing their young near the ocean
			- The ability of plants to grow on their porous exoskeletons allows the plants to spread their seeds further
			- The plants also attract prey, allowing the arachne to idly hunt approaching food
	- Swamp [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/eac696c8ae7d76582765451f)
		- inconsistent depth, muddy waters fill this biome
		- Small shrubbery, but few trees
		- Below the surface are large underwater creatures
			- Person size carnivorous worms in the deeper areas
			- Amphibious monkey-like creatures in the shallower areas
		- At night, flocks of firefly-like insects fill the air
			- The lights signal a rare species of flower to bloom
			- The fireflies nest within the blooms of the flower, laying their eggs
			- When the parent dies, its body is used as a host to grow a new flower where it fell
		- Hippo-like boars roam the surface areas of the swamp
			- These boars are the prey of the monkey-like creatures
			- These are vegetarians, despite their huge teeth
			- The monkeys use the shallow waters to evade herds of the boars
		- Tectonic shifts agitate the waters, sometimes angering the larger worms and drawing them to the surface of the water
	- Tundra
	- Beach
	- Underground
		- Larger interconnected tunnels created by a civilization past
		- Tunnels were made by the taming of some large subterranean creature
		- These creatures are now extinct and the civilization gone
		- But ruins remain
		- Current creatures: 
			- Enormous moth-like insects with long proboscises that can tap into underground reservoirs to extract water. Their iridescent wings filter and refract the ambient light, providing an otherworldly spectacle.
			- Giant ants that cultivate fungi around geothermal vents, using the heat to stimulate the growth of luminescent mushrooms. They have a complex caste system and navigate through the tunnels with exceptional teamwork.
	- Volcano
	- Ocean
