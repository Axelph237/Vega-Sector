## Melee Weapons

## Ranged Weapons

### Range
Ranged weapons have an optimal range denoted as `low #-high #`. A target who is between or at these distances is considered to be **in range**, otherwise they are **out of range**.

### Stability Checks
A ranged weapon has two different `stability` numbers shown in a pair as `(lower # / higher #)`. The lower of the two numbers is used for `stability` checks when the target is out of range. Otherwise, the higher number is used.

## Firearms
Firearms are considered ranged weapons, but also have their own special rules.

### Stability Checks
Firearms use a unique set of dice when making `stability` checks. This set of dice is determined by the firearm's `handling` stat. For instance, if a weapon has a `handling` of `2d6,1d4` it would roll two d6s and a d4 in order to make its `stability` check.
