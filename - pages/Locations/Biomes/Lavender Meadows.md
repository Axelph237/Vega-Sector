The Lavender Meadows are a beautiful sight to behold. Vast, rolling hills of a deep purple only broken by the occasional speckles of white and orange flowers crowning the grasses. Peaceful streams break the space between bluffs, a gentle breeze blowing across the air.
## Description
Generally peaceful, these rolling mounds are the home to a variety of small prey species.

## Notable Inhabitants
### Fauna
**Cragula**
Often mistaken for rock formations amongst the plains, craguli are instead large predatory species. The "gentle giant" of the Lavender Meadows, craguli spend their entire lives wander across the purple expanse.
