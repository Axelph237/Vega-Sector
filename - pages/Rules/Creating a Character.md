## Attributes
All characters are first defined by a set of four attributes. These four attributes attributes give an overview of how the character feels. Here is a short description of the four attributes:
- `Heft`: How physically powerful a character is
- `Grace`: How agile a character is
- `Ingenuity`: How smart, intelligent, or wise a character is
- `Empathy`: How friendly and how capable a character is of understanding emotions

## Backgrounds
These attributes are largely determined by a character's backgrounds. The player's first job is to choose 2 backgrounds for their character. They first choose a primary background, then a secondary background. A player starts with +2 in all 4 attributes. If a character were to ever have negative in an attribute, they must instead subtract that value from another attribute of their choice.
