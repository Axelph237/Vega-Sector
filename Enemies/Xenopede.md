**Xenopede:** Xenopedes create massive, intricate mosaic webs, out crystals harvested by their large mandibles and hang them on the web they then sit on the web and shine with a bioluminescence, their glow reflected by the crystals. This simulates the same glow of the hanging fruit of the berries their main source of food are the Unmossa Geckos, they are nocturnal praetors. When desperate they are even known to attempt to strike and kill the large Umbral glade moths
