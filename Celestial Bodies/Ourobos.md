**Vega-b3**, also known as **Ourobos**, is one of the few habitable bodies within the Vega system. The gravitation pull of Vega-b allows for a moon such as **Ourobos** to exist. Additionally, due to the extreme light conditions, it has grown to house an extremely lush environment.

## Description
Ourobos is a place that instantly quenches all other ideas of beauty upon arrival. The moon flaunts a diverse landscape, filled with both extremely elevated mountain ranges, and extensive flat deserts. Not only this, but the body is adorned with a broad spectrum of different colors. A full and bright spectrum of light being presented to the flora on Ourobos makes its inhabitants equally vibrant.

### Phenomena
The moon experiences a higher gravity at night than during the day, creating a dynamic and physically demanding daily rhythm for both the terrain and the lifeforms. Because of this shift, many of the creatures on the planet have resulted to living diurnal lives. Only the most powerful of species have been able to evolve in such a way as to efficiently hunt in the night time. This dynamic has led to an increase in robust, nocturnal predators and advanced self-defense tactics among prey species.

Additionally, Ourobos is characterized by intense plate tectonics, resulting in rugged landscapes and frequent seismic activity. Along with the higher gravity at night, mild to severe earthquakes are a common occurrence. The long term effects of these shifts has been a general elevated terrain, with some locations having extreme verticality. The oceans on Ourobos have also been affected by these tectonic changes.

Due to high electric charge within the system, weather conditions are extreme, with extensive volatile storms. The local flora and fauna have since grown to necessitate this phenomena. Many species evolved to gain energy from the consumption of the fruit from Voltflare bushes.

### Flora & Fauna
`Written by ChatGPT (change)`
The diurnal cycle plays a crucial role in the moon's ecosystem, as animals are more active during the day to capitalize on the limited time of lower gravity. However, the nocturnal predators, exceptionally strong and powerful, pose a constant threat. Diurnal animals have evolved various passive self-defense mechanisms to navigate the hazardous nocturnal landscape, from camouflage to toxin production, ensuring their survival in this challenging planetary crucible.
