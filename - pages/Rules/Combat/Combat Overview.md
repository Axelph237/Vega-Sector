## Start of Combat
At the start of combat, all creatures must be put into initiative order, highest to lowest. If a player and an NPC share initiative, the player goes first.

## Round Phase

During the round, all creatures may take actions at any point they see fit so long as another creature is not currently performing an action.

In order to perform an action, a creature must have enough `stamina points` to perform it. A creature regains up to their maximum `stamina points` during their turn in initiative. After a creature regains `stamina points` during their turn, they must perform at least one action on that same turn.
