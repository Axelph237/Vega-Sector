**Vega-b3**, also known as **Ourobos**, is one of the few habitable bodies within the Vega system. The gravitation pull of Vega-b allows for a moon such as **Ourobos** to exist. Additionally, due to the extreme light conditions, it has grown to house an extremely lush environment.

## Description
`Written by ChatGPT (change)`
The moon is characterized by a diverse landscape, filled with various habitats and landscapes keeping its 
Ourobos experiences a gravitational oddity where gravity is higher at night than during the day, creating a dynamic and physically demanding daily rhythm for both the terrain and the lifeforms. 

### Phenomena

The diurnal cycle plays a crucial role in the moon's ecosystem, as animals are more active during the day to capitalize on the limited time of lower gravity. However, the nocturnal predators, exceptionally strong and powerful, pose a constant threat. Diurnal animals have evolved various passive self-defense mechanisms to navigate the hazardous nocturnal landscape, from camouflage to toxin production, ensuring their survival in this challenging planetary crucible.
