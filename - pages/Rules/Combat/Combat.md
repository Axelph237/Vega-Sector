# Overview
In Vega Sector, combat happens over a series of *rounds*, each of which consists of a *game*. Each game functions similarly to a game of poker, but without betting or bluffing. Before combat, each player will choose to take their actions during one of the six separate *phases* within a round.  Each phase has no distinct difference, but represent different times in combat that actions are taken.
# Combat Flow
## Upkeep
Each round of combat begins with an upkeep phase. During this phase, the following happens:
- GM reshuffles the deck
- Beginning of round effects are resolved
- A new game is set
	- Deal 4 cards to each player
	- Flip a number of cards from the deck faceup equal to the round number (1 for Round 1, 2 for Round 2, etc.)
	- Each player gets a chance to exchange one of their cards with another player (Each player can swap up to twice, once at someone else' request, and once at their own)

## Phases
After upkeep is completed, play moves into the round phases. Starting with phase 1, any players in the phase take their turn (order of their choice), followed by any NPCs in that phase.
# Player Turns
During a player's turn, they have the option to play up to two "hands." Each "hand" must be a valid hand in poker. For instance, a player could look at their four cards and play two high card, a high card and a pair, two pair, etc.
