Movement is performed along a square grid. Movement from one square to any cardinally or diagonally adjacent square is considered to be 5 feet of movement. Some tiles may be considered *difficult terrain*. A tile that is difficult terrain takes a bonus 5 feet of movement to enter. Additionally, a Game Master may choose to make other forms of movement considered difficult terrain. Some of these include things like scaling stairs and opening doors. 

Here are some examples of difficult terrain:
- Waist-high water
- A closed door
- Vaulting a short wall
- Dense shrubbery
