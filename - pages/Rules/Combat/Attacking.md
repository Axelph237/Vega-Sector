When taking an attack action, an attack may be made with any currently readied weapon the player has. The first step of an attack is choosing a target, followed by determining if the attack hits, then seeing how much damage is dealt.
## Choosing a Target
Unless otherwise specified, a creature may target any creature that is within line of sight. Line of sight is any creature who is not full obstructed in relation to the attacking creature's position. Essentially, draw a line between the attacker and the potential target. If there is any full obstruction between them, that is not a valid target.
## Determining Hits
When seeing if an attack hits, the creature must make a `stability` check with the current weapon. The `stability` of a weapon is the target number to roll under in order to successfully hit a target. Melee weapons only have one `stability` number, where ranged weapons have two (See [[Attacking#Ranged Weapons#Stability Checks|Ranged Weapons]] for more info). The standard dice for a `stability` check is `2d12`. However, this is different for [[Attacking#Firearms#Stability Checks|firearms]]. If a hit is successful, damage is dealt and/or on-hit affects are triggered.
## Dealing Damage
A weapon deals damage equal to its `power` dice. Simply roll these dice to see how much damage is dealt to the target. Some types of weapons may deal damage differently such as [[Weapons#Firearms|firearms]] as well as [[Tags#Explosive|explosive]] items.
