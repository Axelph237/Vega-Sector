## Start of Combat
At the start of combat, all creatures must be put into initiative order, highest to lowest. If a player and an NPC share initiative, the player goes first.

## Round Phase
The primary event occurring during a round of combat are creature [[turns]]. During a creature's turn it regains `stamina points` and takes any actions it chooses to before interruption.

At any point in initiative, after all creatures at that initiative have taken their turns, any other creature may perform an action. In order to do this, a creature must have enough remain `stamina points` from their previous turn. 

## End of Combat
Once combat has ended, narrative play immediately begins.
