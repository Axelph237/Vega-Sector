# Overview
In Vega Sector, combat happens over a series of *rounds*, each of which consists of a *game*. Each *game* functions similarly to a game of poker, but without betting or bluffing. Before combat, each player will choose to take their actions during one of the six separate *phases* within a round.  Each *phase* has no distinct difference, but represent different times in combat that actions are taken.
# Combat Flow
## Upkeep
Each round of combat begins with an upkeep phase. During this phase, the following happens:
- GM reshuffles the deck
- Beginning of round effects are resolved
- A new *game* is set
	- Deal 4 cards to each player
	- Flip a number of cards from the deck faceup equal to the round number (1 for Round 1, 2 for Round 2, etc.). These are *shared* cards.
	- Each player gets a chance to exchange one of their cards with another player (Each player can swap up to twice, once at someone else' request, and once at their own)
## Phases
After upkeep is completed, play moves into the round *phases*. Starting with phase 1, any players in the *phase* take their turn (order of their choice), followed by any NPCs in that phase.
# Player Turns
During a player's turn, they have the option to play up to two "hands." Each "hand" must be a valid hand in poker. For instance, a player could look at their four cards and play two high card, a high card and a pair, two pair, etc. When one of that player's cards is used in a "hand," it may not be used a second time and is discarded.

Additionally, players can count *shared* cards towards any "hand" higher rank than a high card. This means that if a card such as a King is in the *shared* cards, they could play a King from their hand as a pair. They cannot, however, use the *shared* King as a high card.
## "Hand" Actions
Each "hand" played represents an action that the player can then take.
