During combat and narrative moments, a Game Master may want to ensure that a character is able to successfully complete a given task. This is the same as in any other Table Top RPG game. When a player chooses to take an action or has something occur to them, the Game Master may call a skill check.

When calling a skill check the Game Master should first say what attribute is related to the check, and then why the player is rolling.

For instance, if a player is being shot at during their sprint across a battlefield, the Game Master could say, "Make a `Grace` check to *see if you are hit by gunfire during the sprint*." At this point, the player will look at their active `Grace` proficiencies and select any one that they believe to be the most applicable for the circumstance. If there is no relevant proficiency, then none may be selected. 

## Making the Roll
After a relevant proficiency is selected, the player will then make a dice roll of `2d12` plus the modifiers of their selected proficiency.
