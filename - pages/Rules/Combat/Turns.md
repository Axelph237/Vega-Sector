A creature's turn is broken down into the following steps: **Upkeep**, **Actions**, **Resolution**

## Upkeep
During the upkeep phase, any relevant "beginning-of-turn" effects on the creature are updated. 

## Actions
At the beginning of the action phase, a creature regains all of its `stamina points`. It then must take at least one action.

### Taking Actions
When a creature takes an action, it must spend `stamina points` equal to the action's `exhaustion`. After an action is taken, it may not be taken again during the same turn. 

The most common action a creature will take on its turn is an [[Attacking|attack]]. In addition to attacks, creatures may also [[Movement|move]] up to a limited number of spaces as a free action.


## Resolution
The resolution phase is used for any "end-of-turn" effects. It is essentially identical to the upkeep phase. However, unlike the upkeep phase, the resolution phase may include things that happened as a result of a creatures action phase.
