During combat and narrative moments, a Game Master may want to ensure that a character is able to successfully complete a given task. This is the same as in any other Table Top RPG game. When a player chooses to take an action or has something occur to them, the Game Master may call a skill check. 

## Selecting Relevant Skills

> ## Target Numbers

> | --- | --- |

> | Insane | 20 |

> | Moderate | 10 |
> | Simple | 8 |

When calling a skill check the Game Master should first state the difficulty of the check, then what attribute is related to the check, and finally why the player is rolling. The difficulty of the check should be determined by the associated consequence of the action. 

For instance, if a player is being shot at during their sprint across a battlefield, the Game Master could say, "Make a difficult `Grace` check to *see if you are hit by gunfire during the sprint*." At this point, the player will look at their active `Grace` proficiencies and select any one that they believe to be the most applicable for the circumstance. If there is no relevant proficiency, then none may be selected.

## Making the Roll
After a relevant proficiency is selected, the player will then make a dice roll of `2d12` plus the modifiers of their selected proficiency. In the case of the example above, the player would need to achieve a roll of 14 or higher in order to pass the check. If the check is passed, the player successfully completes the action. Otherwise, the prospected negative outcome should occur.

## Modifying the Target Number
Additionally, a Game Master may minorly increase or decrease a skill check's target number before the roll. This can be for any reason they see fit in the situation.
