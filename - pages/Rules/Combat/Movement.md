## Grid
Movement is performed along a square grid. Movement from one square to any cardinally or diagonally adjacent square is considered to be 5 feet of movement. 

## Difficult Terrain
Some tiles may be considered *difficult terrain*. A tile that is difficult terrain takes a bonus 5 feet of movement to enter. Additionally, a Game Master may choose to make other forms of movement considered difficult terrain. Some of these include things like scaling stairs and opening doors. 

Here are some examples of difficult terrain:
- Waist-high water
- A closed door
- Vaulting a short wall
- Dense shrubbery

## Types of Movement
There are various types of movement that each handle a player's base movement stat differently.

**Walking**
This is the default form of movement. Walking counts a player's base movement normally.

**Sprinting**
When a player is sprinting, their base movement speed is doubled. Sprints can only be made through committing a Sprint action. During a sprint, a player's and enemy accuracies are halved.

**Swimming**
During swimming, all tiles traversed are difficult terrain. Additionally, no action requiring `Grace` can be performed while in water.
