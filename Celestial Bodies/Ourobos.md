**Vega-b3**, also known as **Ourobos**, is one of the few habitable bodies within the Vega system. The gravitation pull of Vega-b allows for a moon such as **Ourobos** to exist. Additionally, due to the extreme light conditions, it has grown to house an extremely lush environment.

## Description
Ourobos is a place that instantly quenches all other ideas of beauty upon arrival. The moon flaunts a diverse landscape, filled with both extremely elevated mountain ranges, and extensive flat deserts. Not only this, but the body is adorned with a broad spectrum of different colors. A full and bright spectrum of light being presented to the flora on Ourobos makes its inhabitants equally vibrant.

The moon experiences a higher gravity at night than during the day, creating a dynamic and physically demanding daily rhythm for both the terrain and the lifeforms. 

### Phenomena

### Flora & Fauna

The diurnal cycle plays a crucial role in the moon's ecosystem, as animals are more active during the day to capitalize on the limited time of lower gravity. However, the nocturnal predators, exceptionally strong and powerful, pose a constant threat. Diurnal animals have evolved various passive self-defense mechanisms to navigate the hazardous nocturnal landscape, from camouflage to toxin production, ensuring their survival in this challenging planetary crucible.
