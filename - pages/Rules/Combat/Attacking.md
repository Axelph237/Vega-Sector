When taking an attack action, an attack may be made with any currently readied weapon the player has. The first step of an attack is choosing a target, followed by determining if the attack hits, then seeing how much damage is dealt.
# Choosing a Target
Unless otherwise specified, a creature may target any creature that is within line of sight. Line of sight is any creature who is not full obstructed in relation to the attacking creature's position. Essentially, draw a line between the attacker and the potential target. If there is any full obstruction between them, that is not a valid target.
# Determining Hits
When attacking with a melee weapon, skip rolling to hit and instead skip straight to dealing damage. However, as for ranged weapons, a `stability` check must first be made.
# Dealing Damage
A weapon deals damage equal to its `power` dice. Simply roll these dice to see how much damage is dealt to the target. Some types of weapons may deal damage differently such as firearms as well as [[Tags#Explosive|explosive]] items.
# Weapon Types
## Melee Weapons
Melee weapons have no special rules. For the sake of targeting, a melee weapon may only be used on adjacent creatures.
## Ranged Weapons
Ranged weapons perform much like a melee weapon, but have the additional complexity of determining range.
### Range
Ranged weapons have an optimal range denoted as `low #-high #`. A target who is between or at these distances is considered to be **in range**, otherwise they are **out of range**.
### Stability Checks
A ranged weapon has two different `stability` numbers shown in a pair as `(lower # / higher #)`. The lower of the two numbers is used for `stability` checks when the target is out of range. Otherwise, the higher number is used.
## Firearms
Firearms are considered ranged weapons, but also have their own special rules.
### Making an Attack
After determining a target with a firearm, a creature must choose how many shots they will take. They do this by spending a number of dice from their `magazine` pool from one up to the weapon's `fire rate`. These dice are considered *committed* until the end of the action.
### Determining Hits
Firearms use a unique set of dice when making `stability` checks. This set of dice is determined by the firearm's `handling` stat. For instance, if a weapon has a `handling` of `2d6,1d4` it would roll two d6s and a d4 in order to make its `stability` check.
### Dealing Damage
After rolling to hit, a creature rolls all of its committed dice. For every failed point during the `stability` check, one dice of the creature's choice must be removed from the now rolled *committed* dice. Then, all remaining *committed* dice are totaled to determine the damage dealt.
### Running out of Ammo
When a creature runs out of ammo (usually due to spending all of the dice in their `magazine` pool), they must take a reload action before attacking with this weapon again. A reload is a *simple* action. Reloading refills the `magazine` pool back to its maximum with the weapon's `calibre` dice.
