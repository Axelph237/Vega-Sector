Skills make up a bulk of a character's core progression. Each skill is assigned a parent [[Creating a Character#Attributes|attribute]], relating it to a broader category of skills. 

## Types of Skills
There are two primary kinds of skills, proficiencies and actions. Each of these are considered skills for the sake of anything that refers to skills. However, each are distinct from each other.

### Proficiencies
These are things that a character is particularly good at. There are a variety of different kinds of proficiencies, but most are common proficiencies.

**Common Proficiency**
This kind of proficiency relates to any general ability a character is learning. Common proficiencies grant a roll modifier to any roll made pertaining to the proficiency. For example, a proficiency in lock picking would grant you a roll modifier when picking an analog lock, but would not grant you a modifier when hacking a digital lock.

**Utility Proficiency**
This version of proficiency functions more uniquely than a common proficiency. Utility proficiency is typically on a case-by-case basis. These grant some modifier to the tool they are related to. This typically means a roll modifier (making them similar to common proficiencies), but others can affect different stats.

### Actions
These do not passively affect a character like proficiencies. Instead, an action skill allows a player to take new or improved actions during combat and occasionally narrative phases. They have an action point cost in addition to their effect and [[Creating a Character#Attributes|attribute]] type. 

## Gaining Skills
When a skill is gained, it is added to a character's skill deck. Skills in this deck are inactive and as such grant no effect. 

**Common Proficiencies**
Players can gain common proficiencies during moments of rest. During this time, they can determine something that their character intends to learn and become proficient in. If the Game Master agrees with the scope of the skill, the character may learn it. The player then fills out a blank skill card with the necessary information.

**Utility Proficiencies**
Utility proficiencies are gained during moments of rest. During this time, if the corresponding equipment has been gained a player may take its utility proficiency. Utility proficiencies are predetermined for equipment and are not created by the player.

**Actions**
Actions are most commonly gained on levelling a certain stat to a high enough level, or when a piece of equipment grants a new action. In the case of the latter, this action is only gained when 

## Activating Skills
During a moment of rest, players can choose to rearrange their active skills and skill deck. When a skill is moved from the skill deck to a player's active skills, all of its effects are now in play. In order to move a skill from their skill deck to their active skills, they must have enough open slots of the corresponding attribute. For instance, if a player has a skill in their skill deck that consumes 2 `Grace` slots, they must have at least 2 open slots in `Grace` to move it to their active skills. 

## Improving Skills
After a skill has been gained, it can be mastered. Mastering a skill requires it currently be active. While a skill is being mastered, any time it's used a mark (called an attempt) is added to its skill-card. Once a designated number of marks has been added, the skill promotes to the next tier. Higher tier skill cards give improved or new bonuses to players.

In addition to mastering skills, players can spend money during times of rest for marks on active and inactive skills. The standard cost of an attempt is `INSERT ATTEMPT COST HERE`.
