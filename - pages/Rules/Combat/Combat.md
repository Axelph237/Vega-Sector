# Overview
In Vega Sector, combat happens over a series of *rounds*, each of which consists of a *game*. Each *game* functions similarly to a game of poker, but without betting or bluffing. Before combat, each player will choose to take their actions during one of the six separate *phases* within a round.  Each *phase* has no distinct difference, but represent different times in combat that actions are taken.
# Combat Flow
## Upkeep
Each round of combat begins with an upkeep phase. During this phase, the following happens:
- GM reshuffles the deck (Standard 52 cards + 2 jokers)
- Beginning of round effects are resolved
- A new *game* is set
	- Deal 4 cards to each player
	- Deal (# of enemy types) + 1 cards to the GM
	- Flip a number of cards from the deck faceup equal to the round number (1 for Round 1, 2 for Round 2, etc.). These are *shared* cards.
	- Each player gets a chance to exchange one of their cards with another player (Each player can swap up to twice, once at someone else' request, and once at their own)
## Phases
After upkeep is completed, play moves into the round *phases*. Starting with phase 1, any players in the *phase* take their turn (order of their choice), followed by any NPCs in that phase.
# Player Turns
During a player's turn, they have the option to play up to two "hands." Each "hand" must be a valid hand in poker. For instance, a player could look at their four cards and play two high card, a high card and a pair, two pair, etc. When one of that player's cards is used in a "hand," it may not be used a second time and is discarded.

Additionally, players can count *shared* cards towards any "hand" higher rank than a high card. This means that if a card such as a King is in the *shared* cards, they could play a King from their hand as a pair. They cannot, however, use the *shared* King as a high card.

After a player has played up to two "hands" or has chosen to pass, they will discard the remaining cards in their hand. Their turn is now over. Play will then continue in phase order.
## "Hand" Actions
Each "hand" played represents an action that the player can then take.

## Action Types
### Simple Action
Simple actions include things like:
- Movement
- Melee attacks
- Readying weapons
- Using items
And other basic interactions.
### Standard Action
Standard actions include things like:
- Ranged attacks
- Special skills
- Charged small actions
And other complex interactions.
### Heavy Action
Heavy actions include combat swaying abilities like:
- Special abilities
- Heavy weapon usage
- Attack combos
And other difficult/intensive interactions.
### Improvising
As a GM, it is good to encourage your players to think outside of the actions in front of them. What this requires, though, is some improvising from the GM on the cost of certain actions. Here is how this conversation may go:
> Player: "What would it cost me to throw this chair?"
> GM: "Hmm... Probably just a simple action!"
> Player: "And to vault this table?"
> GM: "Not  even an action, just part of your movement... what are you planning?"
## Nuances in Turn Order
During play, you may begin to realize that certain actions wouldn't affect a player who has already taken their turn. For this reason, the following should be considered:
- If a player (A) would cause another player (B) who has already taken their turn to draw, then that player (B) will draw an additional card at the start of the following round.
# Enemy Turns
## Resolving Enemy Turns
A GM may choose one of two ways to resolve enemy turns. One of which is by group, and the other is by individual enemies. Typically, if the number of enemies outnumbers the players, handling their actions by group is faster than individually. However, if the GM wants to make the combat feel more dynamic, they can take actions for each enemy individually. Regardless, enemy "hands" are played for an entire group of enemies.
## Determining Actions
No matter which way a GM decides to resolve enemy turns, actions (and revenge) must be taken! Each type of enemy will have a set of actions that it will take depending on the roll of a D12. Typically, the higher the number the more dangerous of an action taken. As the GM, rolls may be changed in benefit or against the players. However, trust the dice, typically only change the value of the roll made by +/-1.
## Playing Enemy "Hands"
Like with player turns, enemies have the chance to play cards to take advantage of shifting tides in battle. Most enemy actions have a bonus effect if taken when a certain "hand" is also played. After enemy actions are determined for a group (either through group or individual rolls), the GM may play a "hand" from their set of cards (including *shared* cards). That "hand" counts for the entire group, so if actions were determined individually, all enemies might not always benefit from the hand played.
