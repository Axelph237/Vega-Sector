When taking an attack action, an attack may be made with any currently readied weapon the player has. The first step of an attack is choosing a target, followed by determining if the attack hits, then seeing how much damage is dealt.
## Choosing a Target
Unless otherwise specified, a creature may target any creature that is within line of sight. Line of sight is any creature who is not full obstructed in relation to the attacking creature's position. Essentially, draw a line between the attacker and the potential target. If there is any full obstruction between them, that is not a valid target.
## Determining Hits
When attacking with a melee weapon, skip rolling to hit and instead skip straight to dealing damage. However, as for ranged weapons, 
## Dealing Damage
A weapon deals damage equal to its `power` dice. Simply roll these dice to see how much damage is dealt to the target. Some types of weapons may deal damage differently such as [[Weapons#Firearms|firearms]] as well as [[Tags#Explosive|explosive]] items.
