Keep the following in mind when creating a Planet
```
1. **Physical Characteristics:**
    
    - Describe the planet's size, gravity, atmosphere, and terrain. Is it rocky, gaseous, or perhaps covered in vast oceans? What does the landscape look like? Are there unique geological features?
2. **Flora and Fauna:**
    
    - Develop a diverse ecosystem with unique plants and animals. Consider how these life forms have adapted to the planet's environment. Are there symbiotic relationships or predatory hierarchies?
3. **Climate and Weather:**
    
    - Explore the planet's climate zones, weather patterns, and any extreme conditions. How do these factors impact the inhabitants and their way of life?
4. **Cultural and Societal Elements:**
    
    - Define the social structures, traditions, and customs of the indigenous species. What are their values and belief systems? How do they organize themselves, and what role does community play?
5. **Technology and Resources:**
    
    - Determine the level of technological advancement on the planet. What resources are abundant or scarce, and how do inhabitants utilize them? Are there any advanced or mysterious technologies?
6. **History and Mythology:**
    
    - Create a rich history for the planet, including key events that have shaped its current state. Develop myths, legends, and folklore that provide insight into the cultural background.
7. **Language and Communication:**
    
    - Consider how inhabitants communicate. Is there a unique language or system of communication? How do different species interact with each other?
8. **Conflict and Cooperation:**
    
    - Explore potential conflicts or alliances between different factions or species. What are the underlying tensions, and are there ongoing struggles for resources or power?
9. **Geopolitical Dynamics:**
    
    - If there are multiple regions or nations on the planet, outline their geopolitical relationships. What are the political structures, and how do they interact with each other?
10. **Exploration and Discovery:**
    
    - Introduce the concept of exploration. Are there uncharted territories or hidden secrets waiting to be discovered? What drives characters to explore and venture into the unknown?
11. **Cultural Exchange:**
    
    - Consider opportunities for cultural exchange between the alien species and any potential human visitors. How do these interactions shape both societies?
12. **Environmental Impact:**
