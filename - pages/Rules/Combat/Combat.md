# Overview
In Vega Sector, combat happens over a series of *rounds*, each of which consists of a *game*. Each game functions similarly to a game of poker, but without betting or bluffing. Before combat, each player will choose to take an action during one of the six separate *phases* within a round.  Each phase has no distinct difference, but represent different times in combat that actions are taken.
