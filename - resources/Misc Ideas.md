# Ourobos
- Ourobos 
	- Gravity is higher at night than in day
		- This implies that fauna utilizes low gravity during the day, also there might be rocks and structures that float around making some places very dangerous in terms of collision, places with high density of flora are ironically safer because rocks are "tied down"
	- Has high plate tectonics
	- Extreme weather conditions
	- Animals are more active during the day
	- Nocturnal predators are extremely strong and powerful
	- Diurnal animals have lots of passive self defense mechanics to avoid said predators
	- Plants that can store electric charge from lightning strikes (voltflare bush)
		- These plants act like lightning rods

- Biomes
	- Desert [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/352f445c5470b9b4c7faf0e6)
		- Largely covered in a sand made from volcanic rock
			- Combination darker rocks and quartz
		- The volcanic rock was eroded by an ocean that was once there
		- after it had dried up, the residual sand is a mix of black and white
		- Due to tectonic shifts, the larger quartz pebbles are sifted from the darker sands creating streams of white and black pebbles across the desert
		- Photosynthesizing animals
			- Big lizard with a coat of scales that reflect and absorb light for energy
				- This makes them a great mode of transportation due to their passive mode of energizing
			- Insects with transparent wings that refract sunlight, creating a dazzling display as they skim over the sand. Their bodies are equipped with crystalline structures that allow them to convert sunlight into energy.
				- Maybe also potentially rideable ðŸ‘€
		- Birds with reflective feathers that use the shimmering of the light to communicate
			- Feast on a plant that extracts minerals from the quartz. They use these minerals to produce their reflective sheen
	- Silent Forest (variant)
		- Peaceful ambiance
		- A creature that resembles an inviting species (from wherever you are native)
			- No one knows what it truly looks like
			- But no one survives a close proximity encounter with it
			- Due to this, the forest is largely silent aside from these creatures
			- Although not carnivorous, they are highly territorial, leading to the aggressive nature
			- These creatures are nomadic
		- The forests are... oddly silent
	- Forest  [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/ec8f5ef3b664f1eb909fbb73)
		- 
	- Lush Forest [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/f6e3c5a0d9956cc4a14cacbc)
		- Extreme verticality and cliffsides
		- Large, green trees
		- Wide rivers and lakes
		- Small, reptilian creatures scutter across the ground
		- Many small bird species live here
		- Nocturnal predators lie camouflaged in the trees during the day
			- These creatures, of a slick form, come out at night to hunt prey
			- They will generally eat whatever seems possible to them
		- Some insects have eyes across their back abdomen
			- This allows them to crawl along trees and look out into the grottos
	- Hills [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/fde5ecfcbaade48586916db3)
		- Covered in vast fields of a light purple grass
		- The grass sparkles at the blinking of stars in the night
		- Adorned with a variety of saturated orange and white flowers
		- Hilly terrain with a variety of streams running along it
		- Mostly maintains prey vegetarians
		- Some flying creatures make migrations across the fields during the day
		- A species of massive arachne creatures roam the fields, covered in the flora of the plains
			- These creatures make a migration their whole lives from one end of the fields to the other, birthing their young near the ocean
			- The ability of plants to grow on their porous exoskeletons allows the plants to spread their seeds further
			- The plants also attract prey, allowing the arachne to idly hunt approaching food
	- Swamp [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/eac696c8ae7d76582765451f)
		- inconsistent depth, muddy waters fill this biome
		- Small shrubbery, but few trees
		- Below the surface are large underwater creatures
			- Person size carnivorous worms in the deeper areas
			- Amphibious monkey-like creatures in the shallower areas
		- At night, flocks of firefly-like insects fill the air
			- The lights signal a rare species of flower to bloom
			- The fireflies nest within the blooms of the flower, laying their eggs
			- When the parent dies, its body is used as a host to grow a new flower where it fell
		- Hippo-like boars roam the surface areas of the swamp
			- These boars are the prey of the monkey-like creatures
			- These are vegetarians, despite their huge teeth
			- The monkeys use the shallow waters to evade herds of the boars
		- Tectonic shifts agitate the waters, sometimes angering the larger worms and drawing them to the surface of the water
	- Underground
		- Larger interconnected tunnels created by a civilization past
		- Tunnels were made by the taming of some large subterranean creature
		- These creatures are now extinct and the civilization gone
		- But ruins remain
		- Current creatures: 
			- Enormous moth-like insects with long proboscises that can tap into underground reservoirs to extract water. Their iridescent wings filter and refract the ambient light, providing an otherworldly spectacle. `GPT`
			- Giant ants that cultivate fungi around geothermal vents, using the heat to stimulate the growth of luminescent mushrooms. They have a complex caste system and navigate through the tunnels with exceptional teamwork. `GPT`
				- Very territorial
				- Will battle other colonies
			- Squid polyp like creature that feeds off of toxic gasses in the air. They are indications of toxic environments.
			- Glass skinned gecko that eats the fruit of a cave roof hanging plant
				- the plant is propagated underground and grows upwards
				- It breaks through the surface
				- Its fruit is bioluminescent (think glowberries)
				- when well lit due to the consumption of fruit, will seek out other well lit geckos to mate
			- Large, bioluminescent centipedes
				- Create massive, intricate mosaic webs
				- They use crystals harvested by their large mandibles and hang them on the web
				- They then sit on the web and shine with a bioluminescence, their glow reflected by the crystals
				- This simulates the same glow of the hanging fruit of the berries
				- Their main source of food are the geckos
			- Worm species that hides near geothermal vents
				- In contest with the ants
				- secretes a tar like substance
				- The tar coalesces onto debris dug by the worms
				- This creates a multitude of spikes attached to the worms
				- Like a porcupine, they can launch these spikes
	- Volcano
	- Heath

# Combat

**Feel:**
- I want turns to go quickly as far as decision making goes
- I want players to feel cool
- I want players to have options
- I *really* want consumables to be worth using
	- Maybe get rid of consumables for reusable items
- I want players to feel like it is a shooter game
- I want positioning to matter
- Guns should feel different from one another
- I don't want combat to feel rigged or impossible
	- Dice rolls should rarely be all-or-nothing
- **Dice rolls and systems should mimic the feel of using that weapon**
	- i.e. rolling a 1d4 for a sniper rifle would be too light in correspondence

**Mechanics:**
- Will need to be action based in some manner
	- I want actions to be expendable, not so heavy like in DND
		- DND actions are very valuable because they are the bulk of your turn, so they are few and far between
- Try to keep math simple. Maybe only addition
	- If subtraction, make it minimal (digits 1-9)
	- If multiplication, make it minimal (only halfing)
	- Possibly no multiplication

**Guns:**
```
Global Stats:
- Handleability
- Stability
```
- Will have different mechanics based on magazine type
- Will also have a number of rounds they can shoot in a turn
- Your `handleability` affects your movement, dodge, and draw speeds.
- The `stability` of a weapon dictates the TN you roll under to hit

Magazine based:
```
Stats:
- Fire Rate
- Magazine Size
```
- You have a dice pool equal to your `magazine size`
- You also have a `fire rate` equaling the number of dice you can use in an action
